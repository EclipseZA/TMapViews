**In Progress**

TMapViews aims to create a more convenients implimentation of maps on IOS and Android in Xamarin. *Boilerplate* code has been rolled into a more userfirendly set-up structure, allowing for easier set-up and life-cycle managment of maps.
TMapViews also wraps various map events, such as ***map clicked*** or ***user location changed*** into a command-based stucture, using a set of common return types that makes use of these events easier within a shared code layer, especially within an MVVM binding structure.
